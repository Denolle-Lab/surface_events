# Surface Events

The purpose of this project is to derive the flow velocities of surface events (ie. Avalanches, rockfalls, debris flows, etc.) on the Cascade Volcanoes in the PNW. The volcanoes These events are hazardous to the surrounding area,  frequent and do not have automated analysis as earthquakes do. We use seismic data from the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network (PNSN) and use a grid search to locate events and a doppler shift algorithm to derive the flow velocity.
