# Surface Events
Surface events such as Avalanches, rockfalls, debris flows, etc. are prevalent on the Cascade Volcanoes in the Pacific Northwest and are hazardous to the surrounding area. They are frequent yet do not have the same automated analysis as earthquakes. Using seismic data from the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network (PNSN), we aim to locate these events with a grid search model and derive the flow velocities and directions of these events using a Doppler shift algorithm.

## Dependencies
Environment: 
```sh
conda env create environment.yml
```

Data: 
- Surface Event Seismic Data is from the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network. The catalog can be found [here](https://seismica.library.mcgill.ca/article/view/368) and the station and waveform data can be downloaded using pnwstore Client. 
- DEM data is obtained from the University of Washington and can be found [here](https://gis.ess.washington.edu/data/raster/tenmeter/). It is processed and prepared for the workflow in Data/DEM_data/Volc_Dem.ipynb
- Labels to certain events are obtained from Wes Thelen of the Cascade Volcano Observatory
